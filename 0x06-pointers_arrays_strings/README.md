# 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

---

### [0. strcat](./0-strcat.c)
* Write a function that concatenates two strings

### [1. strncat ](./1-strncat.c)
* Write a function that concatenates two strings.

### [2. strncpy](./2-strncpy.c)
* Write a function that copies a string.

### [3. strcmp](./3-strcmp.c)
* Write a function that compares two strings.

### [4. rev_array ](./4-rev_array.c)
* Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
(I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy)

### [5. Always look up](./5-string_toupper.c)
* Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

### [6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes](./6-cap_string.c)
* Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

### [7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody](./7-leet.c)
* Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

### [8. Double pointer, double fun](./9-set_string.c)
* Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
